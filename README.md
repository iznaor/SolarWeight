# SolarWeight
My codecademy C++ solution to weight on other planets
Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

I needed to write a C++ program that helps keep track of his target weight.

The following was to be included:
It should ask him what his earth weight is.
Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.
It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.
